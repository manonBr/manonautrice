<!-- ## Project Overview:
My first React project - getting trending movies and movies info from api. The React Movie Info App is a web application designed to provide users with comprehensive movie information sourced from an external API. The primary goal of this project is to create a user-friendly interface for searching and exploring movie details, including cast, and reviews.

## Project Specifications:
Trending Movies: Users can follow up best 20 trending movies nowadays.
Movie Search: Users can search for movies by title, allowing for easy discovery of films they are interested in.
Movie Details: The app provides detailed information about each movie, including its title, release year, genre, and an average score.
Cast: Users can explore the actors involved in the making of each movie.
Reviews: Users can check all the reviews lefting about movies.
In this project was used React (params/location/refs/routes/route/hashroute/sharedlayout/states/hooks/API/props/libraries/modernNormalize/styledComponents/ReactLoaderSpinner/axios/ReactHotToast/ReactToastife/ReactIcons etc...)

## Technology Stack:
Front-End Framework: React
API Integration: Utilizes a movie information API for data retrieval.
Styling: by Styled Component.
Project Purpose:
The project serves both as a showcase of React development skills and as a practical tool for movie enthusiasts to quickly access movie-related information in one place.

## Challenges Faced:
Implementing API integration to fetch movie data in real-time by axios.
Designing an intuitive and visually appealing user interface.
Handling error responses from the API gracefully to ensure a seamless user experience.
Learning Outcomes:
Through this project, I gained valuable experience in React, state management, API integration, and user interface design. It also reinforced my problem-solving skills and the importance of handling data asynchronously in web applications.

## Future Enhancements:
While the current version of the app provides essential movie information, future enhancements could include user accounts, the ability to save favorite movies.

## Feedback:
I welcome feedback and suggestions from users to improve the application's functionality and user experience.
